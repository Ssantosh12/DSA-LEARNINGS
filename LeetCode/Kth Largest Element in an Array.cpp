// Approach 3/3: QuickSelect Algorithm
// Inspired by the QuickSort algorithm, QuickSelect is a divide-and-conquer technique. 
// It partitions the array around a pivot and recursively searches for the k-th largest element in the appropriate partition. 
// When the pivot is chosen randomly, the algorithm tends to have a linear average-case time complexity, making it faster than the sorting approach for large datasets.

// pivot_index = random.randint(left, right)

// TODO : Learn more about Quick Select Technique and Divide and Conquer so that it can be a tool for other problems.
